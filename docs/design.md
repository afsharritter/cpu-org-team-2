## Overview & Context

This is a Design Document describes the architecture, module breakdown, function specifications, data flow, and implementation plan for a team-developed ARM Assembly program that implements the RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) public-key cryptographic algorithm. The document serves as a collaborative blueprint to guide implementation and ensure all team members share a unified understanding before coding begins.

TODO: Add information about the math behind the algorithm (~1 paragraph)

## Scope & Responsibilities

### In Scope

- The program will prompt the user to enter values for `p`, `q`, and `e`, generate the public and private keys, and display them to the user.
- The program will prompt the user to enter a message, encrypt it, and save it in the file called `encrypted.txt`.
- The program will open the file called `encrypted.txt`, decrypt it, and save it in the file called `decrypted.txt`.
- TODO: Add more in scope if necessary

### Out of Scope

- The program will not accept `p` and `q` values larger than 50.
- The program will not generate `e`. It will prompt the user to enter this value.
- TODO: Add more out of scope if necessary

### Responsibilities

TODO: Summarize the project requirements document and explain the general workflow of the program.

## Goals & Milestones
